## Model Extensions

M-CORD extends CORD's core models with the following model specification
[mcord.xproto](https://github.com/opencord/mcord/blob/master/xos/models/mcord.xproto),
which represents the subscriber that anchors a chain of ServiceInstances:

```proto
message MCordSubscriberInstance (ServiceInstance) {
    option verbose_name = "MCORD Subscriber";
    option description = "This model holds the informations of a Mobile Subscriber in CORD";

    required string imsi_number = 1 [max_length = 30, content_type = "stripped", blank = False, null = False, db_index = False];
    optional string apn_number = 2 [max_length = 30, content_type = "stripped", blank = True, null = True, db_index = False];
    optional int32 ue_status = 3 [max_length = 30, choices = "(('0', 'Detached'), ('1', 'Attached'))", blank = True, null = True, db_index = False];
}
```

## GUI Extensions
